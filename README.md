# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability
## Overview
In this project, I aim to optimize a car manufacturer's pricing and product development decisions. Using data analysis and an interactive Excel dashboard, I'll explore factors like car popularity by market category, the relationship between engine power and price, influential features on pricing, average prices by manufacturer, and the connection between fuel efficiency and engine cylinders. The dashboard will help answer key questions and guide decision-making in the automotive industry.

# Car Data Analysis Project 🚗📊

## Tasks Accomplished
### Task 1: Exploring Car Model Popularity
- 📈 **Task 1.A**: Created a pivot table to display the number of car models in each market category and their popularity scores.
- 📊 **Task 1.B**: Designed a combo chart to visually represent the relationship between market categories and popularity.

### Task 2: Engine Power vs. Price Relationship
- 📈 **Task 2**: Constructed a scatter chart plotting engine power against car prices, with an added trendline to visualize the correlation.

### Task 3: Determining Factors for Car Prices
- 📊 **Task 3**: Employed regression analysis to identify key variables influencing car prices. Created a bar chart to visualize the coefficients of these variables.

### Task 4: Car Prices Across Manufacturers
- 📈 **Task 4.A**: Generated a pivot table showcasing the average car prices for each manufacturer.
- 📊 **Task 4.B**: Developed a bar chart to illustrate the relationship between manufacturers and average prices.

### Task 5: Engine Cylinders and Fuel Efficiency
- 📈 **Task 5.A**: Produced a scatter plot with engine cylinders on the x-axis and highway MPG on the y-axis. Included a trendline to assess the correlation.
- 📊 **Task 5.B**: Calculated the correlation coefficient between the number of cylinders and highway MPG.

### Building the Interactive Dashboard
- 🔍 Created an interactive dashboard using filters and slicers to address client-specific questions and enhance user experience.

## Interactive Dashboard Tasks
### Task 1: Car Price Distribution
- 📉 Stacked column chart to display the distribution of car prices by brand and body style. Utilized filters and slicers to enhance interactivity.

### Task 2: Average MSRPs by Brand and Body Style
- 📊 Clustered column chart for comparing average MSRPs across different car brands and body styles.

### Task 3: Impact of Transmission Type on MSRP
- 📊 Scatter plot chart depicting the relationship between MSRP and transmission type, with symbols for body styles. Calculated average MSRPs for each combination.

### Task 4: Fuel Efficiency Trends
- 📈 Line chart illustrating the trend of fuel efficiency (MPG) over time for each body style. Calculated average MPG for each combination of body style and model year.

### Task 5: Analysis of Horsepower, MPG, and Price
- 📊 Bubble chart to visualize the relationships between horsepower, MPG, and price across different car brands. Assigned colors to brands and labeled bubbles with car model names. Calculated average values for each car brand.

## Conclusion
This project leveraged data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from the car dataset, resulting in an interactive Excel dashboard for clients to explore and answer specific questions. It provided a deeper understanding of car model popularity, pricing factors, manufacturer trends, and more.
